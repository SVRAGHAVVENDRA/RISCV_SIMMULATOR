## Feb 24
* Debugged the major and minor errors
* Checked for different test cases
* Completed Phase1

## Feb 23
* Dealt with memory allocation using Hashmap
* Combining memory with the current code
* Debugged the errors

## Feb 22
* Thought about memory allocation and whether to use hashmap or 2D-array
* Disabled clock as far as now we didn't use it anywhere
* Dealt with the errors while joining the parser and existing code

## Feb 21
* Added a parser class to parse the .data and .text part
* removed the previous input format of a file as it is taking only the .text part
* Changed the input format of a file and distinguished .data and .text part using parser

## Feb 20
* Added some of the instructions that are used in bubble sort and selection sort codes
* Dealt with errors

## Feb 19
* Completed main outline of the code
* Used three classes-Processor, Core, Main
* Added basic instructions used in RISC-V to the core class
* Dealt with errors while joining classes

## Feb 18
* Implemented the code for bubble sort and the selection sort codes in the Ripes software
* Discussed how to start and proceed and shared the work
* Started the implementation of code and shared the ideas
